# 1 Experience
This was the first code asked for my teacher and is the most basic thing you can do. I just needed to print an ASCII art.

# 2 Experience
In this program we were asked to make sort of a menu which has 4 options. If choose option 1, he has to input a number and the programm tell him if it's prime or not. Option 2 the user has to input 2 numbers and the program will shows every prime number between them. Option 3, the user has to input 2 numbers and the program shows  the sum of all the prime numbers between those 2 numebers. Option 4 is for the program to close and any invalid option the program is asked to input another one until is one of the said before.

# 3 Experience
This program was about doing the sum of 2 big numbers (up to 100 digits) generated randomly. This was all about arrays... and it was very painful to do.

# 4 Experience
With this program I learned about structures in C and how I can manipulate them. The program is about creating some kind of register for a vet in which the user has to input information about dogs. Once the user entry the information, a simple menu will display in the console and ask different options about categorizing the information such as by female dogs, dogs who are vaccinated, etc.

# 5 Experience
In this experience I was introduced with the concept of recursion, so I had to wrote a program using only recursion to show all the prime factors of that number. For example: 117 can be writen as the multiplication of 3*3*13, which are all prime numbers.

# 6 Experience
I was introduced to the term divide and conquer and it was pretty tough to understand. I was asked to make a program which return from a array of numbers the lowest posible number which is not included in the array. Example: from the array 3 4 5 6 7 8 the lowest possible number which is not included in the array is 1. Divide and conquer still is a hard topic to me and using binary search wasn't easy. I did a bad implementation and the code doesn't work properly sometimes, maybe gonna look up to it again in the future

# 7 Experience
In this code I was asked to transform a matrix from a .txt file with a specific format into an array of one dimention. Again, I also had to use divide and conquer technique, which is translated into Binary Search again, there's algo included a .py code that generates a .txt file with a random matrix on it.

# 8 Experience
This experience was all about the implementation of the algorithm called State Space Search which is used to solve differents kinds of problems and is even used in AI stuff. Here, I had to use this algorithm to solve a problem in which some imaginary cities are connected by a one way route, the cities were labeled by numbers and the routes was written as a pair of numbers, such as "3 9" meaning that there's a only way route from city 3, to city 9. The input of the program was a file which has a specific structure and it contains all the posible routes between some cities. So by using the algorithm I had to search wich cities can not be reach by from a specific city (start point).

# 9 Experience
The last Experience was about another algorithm called Solutions Space Search, which is a different implementation of the algorithm using in the experience 8, but is a little "monkey side" cause you have to generate all the possible solutions for a problem, and then filter all one by one. Honestly I had a lot of fun with this one and the Experience 8, so I'm very glad with this outcome. In this specific program, I had to search all the possible solutions of a magic square of 3x3, so it has roughtly 9! posible solutions.
